'' USTRING used every way the language allows.
''
'' This is a SHOWCASE and a TEST at the same time. Every construct below is
'' checked, not just compiled, so it doubles as documentation you can trust:
'' if a form is in this file, it works, and the expected value is stated next
'' to it.
''
'' Covered: every declaration form, dynamic and fixed, arrays (static, dynamic,
'' multi-dimensional, initialised), UDTs, inheritance and virtual methods,
'' properties, operator overloads, every parameter mode (BYVAL / BYREF /
'' BYREF AS CONST, dynamic and fixed), pointers, and every return form
'' (BYVAL, BYREF, fixed-length).
''
'' NOT covered, because it is not supported: CONST u AS USTRING = "...".
'' fbc's CONST accepts only FB_DATATYPE_STRING -- WSTRING is rejected too. See
'' the "Known gap" section of README.md. Everything else here works.

'' Two different pointers are in play, and mixing them up is the easy mistake:
''
''   USTRING PTR   points at the DESCRIPTOR -- a whole ustring. Deref it and
''                 you get a ustring you can assign, concatenate and index.
''   USHORT PTR    what STRPTR() gives: the raw UTF-16 CODE UNITS inside it.
''
'' VARPTR gives the first, STRPTR the second, and for a var-len ustring they
'' are different addresses.

'' takes and returns a pointer to a ustring

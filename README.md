# USTRING — a portable, dynamic Unicode string for FreeBASIC

A proposed fourth string type for the [FreeBASIC](https://www.freebasic.net/)
compiler: **dynamic, Unicode, and byte-identical on every target**.

This repository contains a full implementation against fbc 1.20.0 — compiler,
runtime, tests, and documentation — intended for upstream discussion.

`STRING`, `ZSTRING` and `WSTRING` are **not changed in any way**. USTRING is
purely additive.

```basic
dim as ustring u = "héllo"      '' dynamic, grows on demand
u += " wörld"                   '' no fixed capacity to overflow
print len(u)                    '' 11 code units, O(1)
```

## Why

FreeBASIC has three string types, and none of them is a portable Unicode string.

| Type | Dynamic? | Encoding | Element width |
|---|---|---|---|
| `STRING` | yes | none — it is a byte buffer | 1 byte |
| `ZSTRING * N` | no | none — NUL-terminated bytes, for C interop | 1 byte |
| `WSTRING * N` | **no** | `wchar_t`, whatever the platform says | **2 on Windows, 4 on Linux, 1 on DOS** |
| **`USTRING`** | **yes** | **UTF-16, always** | **2 bytes, every target** |

The problem is the last column. The same source builds a UTF-16 string on one
target and a UTF-32 string on another — silently — and whichever you get, you
cannot resize it. That width leaks into every byte offset, every pointer walk,
and every file written.

USTRING fixes both halves at once: one type that is dynamic *and* has a fixed,
known representation everywhere.

---

## A true intrinsic type, not a library

This is the part worth being precise about. USTRING is **not** a UDT, a class,
a macro, or a header you `#include`. It is a data type inside the compiler,
registered exactly the way `ZSTRING` and `WSTRING` are.

**It is a keyword**, sitting on the line below its siblings in the keyword table
with the identical token class and dialect gating:

```basic
( @"ZSTRING"    , FB_TK_ZSTRING     , FB_TKCLASS_KEYWORD , KWD_OPTION_NO_QB ), _
( @"WSTRING"    , FB_TK_WSTRING     , FB_TKCLASS_KEYWORD , KWD_OPTION_NO_QB ), _
( @"USTRING"    , FB_TK_USTRING     , FB_TKCLASS_KEYWORD , KWD_OPTION_NO_QB ), _
```

**It is in the datatype enum.** `FB_DATATYPE_USTRING` (the var-len descriptor)
and `FB_DATATYPE_FIXUSTR` (`USTRING * N`), mirroring the `STRING`/`FIXSTR` pair.
`FB_DT_TYPEMASK` is 5 bits — a hard ceiling of 32 datatypes, of which fbc used
26. These are two of the remaining six.

**It is in all six positional datatype tables** that fbc keeps in lockstep —
`symb-data.bas`, `ir-hlc.bas`, `ir-llvm.bas`, `edbg_stab.bas`,
`symb-mangling.bas`, `emit_x86.bas`. A type that is missing from any one of
these is not a real type.

**Every backend emits it natively**: gcc, gas64, gas x86 (32-bit), and LLVM.
Literals are compile-time constants in their own pool (`{fbuc}`), with a
dedicated `littextu` storage slot holding raw UTF-16 units — so there is no
runtime construction cost and no host-width dependency.

**It participates in the language**, not just in expressions: overload
resolution ranks it, `VAR` infers it, `BYREF`/`BYVAL` parameters and copy-back
work, function results work, UDT fields and arrays are constructed and destroyed
by the generated ctors/dtors, and it has a temp-descriptor pool with the same
descriptor-stealing optimisation `STRING` uses, so `a = b + c + d` stays linear.

What that buys you concretely: **there is no seam.** Every intrinsic works, and
`LEN` is O(1) rather than a scan.

```basic
dim as ustring a = "hello", b = "world"
dim as ustring c = a + ", " + b        '' one assign + N concat-assigns, zero temps

print ucase(c)                         '' HELLO, WORLD
print mid(c, 8, 5)                     '' world
print instr(c, "wor")                  '' 8
print len(c), c[0]                     '' 12   104
```

---

## How it relates to the existing types

USTRING is accepted anywhere `STRING` or `WSTRING` is, converting on the way.

```basic
dim as string  s = "from a byte string"
dim as wstring * 32 w = "from a wide string"
dim as ustring u

u = s                     '' UTF-8 decoded
u = w                     '' re-encoded if wchar_t is not 16-bit
s = u                     '' UTF-8 encoded
w = u

print u & " and " & s     '' mixed concatenation, either order
if( u = s ) then ...      '' cross-type comparison
```

| Conversion | How |
|---|---|
| `STRING` / `ZSTRING` ↔ `USTRING` | **UTF-8, on every target** |
| `WSTRING` ↔ `USTRING` | re-encoded only where `wchar_t` ≠ 16 bits |

Note the deliberate difference from `STRING` ↔ `WSTRING`, which goes through the
C locale and is therefore codepage- and machine-dependent. A portable type
cannot afford that, so USTRING's conversions are fixed and identical everywhere.

Malformed UTF-8 becomes **U+FFFD** rather than raising an error — a text editor
must be able to open a damaged file, not refuse it.

### The one boundary

**Arbitrary binary does not round-trip through a USTRING.** Bytes that are not
valid UTF-8 become U+FFFD and the originals are gone. Binary data belongs in
`STRING`, which is unchanged and still there. This is a design decision, not an
oversight: a type that guarantees an encoding cannot also be a byte bucket.

### Win32 `...W` APIs are free

Where `wchar_t` is 16 bits — i.e. Windows — a ustring already *is* UTF-16, so
passing one to a `WSTRING PTR` parameter is a pointer reinterpret with no
conversion and no copy:

```basic
declare function MessageBoxW( byval hWnd as any ptr, byval txt as wstring ptr, _
                              byval cap as wstring ptr, byval flags as ulong ) as long

dim as ustring msg = "hello"
MessageBoxW( null, msg, msg, 0 )      '' no conversion, no copy
```

Where `wchar_t` is wider the text is re-encoded into a temporary and **the
compiler emits a warning**, so that cost is never invisible to someone
developing on Windows.

---

## Code units, not characters

`LEN`, `[]`, `ASC`, and every position and length in `LEFT`/`RIGHT`/`MID`/
`INSTR` count **UTF-16 code units**. A character outside the Basic Multilingual
Plane is a surrogate pair, so it counts as 2:

```basic
dim as ustring e = wchr(&h20AC)      '' €  — 1 unit
dim as ustring m = wchr(&h1D11E)     '' 𝄞  — 2 units, one character

print len(e), e[0]                   '' 1   8364
print len(m)                         '' 2
```

This is the same answer `WSTRING` already gives on Windows, and it keeps `LEN`
and `[]` O(1). It does mean `MID` can split a surrogate pair — exactly as it can
on a `WSTRING`. That is a property of UTF-16, not something this type
introduces.

`UCASE`/`LCASE` use a **generated** simple case-mapping table over the BMP, not
`towupper()`/`towlower()` — those are locale-dependent and would fold the same
string differently depending on the user's locale and which libc the program
linked against.

---

## Fixed-length form

```basic
dim as ustring * 16 f = "fixed"      '' 16 CODE UNITS (32 bytes)
print len(f)                         '' 5 — the text length
```

`USTRING * N` is NUL-terminated and `LEN` returns the text length, following
`WSTRING * N`. It does **not** space-pad the way `STRING * N` does.

---

## I/O

Where the output goes decides the encoding:

| Destination | Encoding |
|---|---|
| A real Windows console | the wide path — the OS renders UTF-16 directly |
| Files, redirected output, non-Windows consoles | **UTF-8** |

That second row is the point: a ustring written to a file produces a portable
UTF-8 file on every platform. (The existing wstring path writes raw UTF-16
*bytes* when redirected, which no other tool reads as text.)

```basic
dim as integer f = freefile
open "out.txt" for output as #f
print #f, u                          '' UTF-8 on every platform
close #f

open "out.txt" for input encoding "utf16" as #f
line input #f, u                     '' OPEN ... ENCODING is honoured too
close #f
```

`PRINT USING` counts code units in its field widths, so a format field lines up
with what the rest of the type says the length is — and gives the same answer
whether the output is a console or a file.

```basic
print using "[\   \]"; u             '' a 5-unit field
```

## What is supported

Everything below is implemented and covered by tests.

**Operators and intrinsics** — assignment, concatenation (`+`, `&`, `+=`),
comparison, `LEN`, `[]` indexing, `ASC`, `WCHR`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `MID`
(function *and* statement), `INSTR`, `INSTRREV`, `TRIM`/`LTRIM`/`RTRIM`
(including the `ANY` and `EX` forms), `UCASE`, `LCASE`, `SPACE`, `STRING`,
`LSET`, `RSET`, `SWAP`, `VAL`, `STR`, `WSTR`, `HEX`, `FORMAT`.

**Language** — `VAR` inference, `SELECT CASE`, `IIF`, `BYREF`/`BYVAL` parameters
with copy-back, function results (including `BYREF` returns and fixed-length
results), overload resolution, UDT fields, `CAST`/`LET`/property/operator
overloads, arrays (multi-dimensional, `SHARED`, UDT-nested, `REDIM PRESERVE`,
`ERASE`), unions, `COMMON`, `WITH`, type aliases, static locals, `STRPTR`,
`VARPTR`, `SIZEOF`, `ustring ptr`, variadics.

**I/O** — `PRINT`, `WRITE`, `PRINT #`, `WRITE #`, `LINE INPUT`, `LINE INPUT #`,
`INPUT`, `INPUT #`, `PRINT USING`, `PUT`/`GET`, `OPEN ... ENCODING`, `READ`/`DATA`,
`DRAW STRING`.

**Dialects** — available in `-lang fb`, `fblite` and `deprecated`; correctly not
a keyword in `-lang qb`, matching how `ZSTRING` and `WSTRING` are gated.

### Known gap

`CONST u AS USTRING = "abc"` is **not** supported. fbc's `CONST` accepts exactly
one string type, `FB_DATATYPE_STRING` — `WSTRING` is rejected too, so USTRING is
no worse than the type it replaces, but it *is* worse than `STRING`. Supporting
it means threading a literal symbol through `symbReuseOrAddConst`, the const
value union and the expression path, all shared by every string type. That is a
feature addition rather than part of this one, and it is recorded rather than
bolted on. `dim as ustring u = "abc"` works, and the literal is already a
compile-time pool constant, so nothing is lost at runtime.

## Prebuilt compilers

You do not have to build anything to try this. Two ready-to-run installations
are in the repository, produced from this tree and verified before being
committed.

### `fbc-win/` — Windows, 32-bit and 64-bit

```
fbc-win/
  fbc32.exe          32-bit compiler
  fbc64.exe          64-bit compiler
  bin/win32          i686 assembler + linker      shared by both
  bin/win64          x86-64 assembler + linker    shared by both
  inc/               FreeBASIC headers
  lib/win32          32-bit runtime
  lib/win64          64-bit runtime
```

The standard FreeBASIC *standalone* layout: both compilers sit at the top level
and share one `bin/` and one `inc/`, each picking the toolchain and runtime that
matches its target.

```bat
fbc-winbc64.exe hello.bas
fbc-winbc32.exe hello.bas
fbc-winbc64.exe -target win32 hello.bas   :: 64-bit compiler, 32-bit output
```

### `fbc-linux/` — Linux x86-64

```
fbc-linux/
  bin/fbc
  inc/
  lib/freebasic/linux-x86_64
```

```bash
fbc-linux/bin/fbc hello.bas
```

This is a **native** Linux build, not a cross-compile. It came from fbc's own
bootstrap path: the win64 compiler emits C for `linux-x86_64`, and gcc compiles
those 146 files into a Linux `fbc` — so no pre-existing Linux FreeBASIC is
needed to reproduce it.

### Things worth knowing

- **Run `fbc` where it lives.** It derives its installation prefix from its own
  path, so `bin/fbc` must stay beside `inc/` and `lib/`. Copying just the binary
  elsewhere gives `cannot open linker script file`.
- **The Linux binary is committed with its executable bit set** (mode `100755`),
  and `.gitattributes` keeps that tree from being CRLF-converted by a Windows
  clone. If you extract it some other way, `chmod +x bin/fbc`.
- **`fbc-win/bin`'s gcc has no C headers**, exactly as FreeBASIC's own
  distribution ships it. It assembles and links, which is all fbc asks of it,
  but it cannot rebuild the runtime — that needs a full toolchain.
- **The Linux `gfxlib2` is built `-DDISABLE_X11 -DDISABLE_GPM`**, because
  `X11/xpm.h` and `gpm.h` were unavailable on the build machine. Console, fbdev
  and everything else are present. `ffi.h` *was* available there, so `ThreadCall`
  works on the Linux build — unlike the Windows ones here.

---

## Performance: appending

`tests/ustring_append_bench.bas`, best of three runs on each platform.

**Read the units first.** A `STRING` moves 1 byte per character and a `USTRING`
moves 2 (a UTF-16 code unit, on every target). So USTRING taking ~2× the time of
STRING is *parity*, not a loss — the throughput column is the honest comparison.

### Against STRING — same class

2,000,000 single-character appends:

| Platform | STRING | USTRING | USTRING throughput |
|---|---|---|---|
| win64 | 10.71 ms (178 MB/s) | 16.01 ms | **238 MB/s** |
| win32 | 69.50 ms (27 MB/s) | 21.10 ms | **181 MB/s** |
| linux-x86_64 | 8.37 ms (228 MB/s) | 8.51 ms | **449 MB/s** |

USTRING moves twice the bytes at equal or better throughput everywhere. On
Linux it does twice the work in the same wall-clock time. (The win32 STRING
figure is an outlier I have not chased down — it is STRING's number, not
USTRING's, and the other two platforms bracket it.)

### Against WSTRING — a different complexity class

This is the one that matters, and it is structural rather than a tuning detail.
A `WSTRING` has **no length field**, so every append walks to the terminator to
find the end. Appending *n* times costs **O(n²)**. A `USTRING` keeps its length
in the descriptor, so an append is O(1) amortised.

Appending at *n* = 40,000 and again at 2*n*:

| Platform | WSTRING *n* → 2*n* | ratio | USTRING *n* → 2*n* | ratio |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| win64 | 82.45 → 339.56 ms | **4.12** | 0.21 → 0.31 ms | 1.43 |
| win32 | 106.93 → 402.41 ms | **3.76** | 0.40 → 0.50 ms | 1.25 |
| linux-x86_64 | 133.37 → 539.68 ms | **4.05** | 0.15 → 0.35 ms | 2.28 |

A ratio near 4 for doubled work is quadratic; near 2 is linear. At just 40,000
appends USTRING is already **400–900× faster**, and the gap widens with length.

The first version of this benchmark used 2,000,000 appends for all three types
and had to be killed — the WSTRING loop does not finish in any useful time.
That is why its counts are small here.

### Growth is amortised linear

The same append loop at 1× and 4× the count. Linear growth gives ≈4;
realloc-on-every-append would give ≈16.

| Platform | USTRING | STRING |
|---|---|---|
| win64 | 5.38 | 5.37 |
| win32 | 4.18 | 4.10 |
| linux-x86_64 | 4.47 | 4.43 |

USTRING tracks STRING to within a couple of percent on every platform. Both sit
slightly above 4 on win64 — since *both* types show it equally, that is the
memory system at these sizes, not the growth strategy.

---

## Tests

### fbc's own test suite

fbc has three test targets. **All three were run**; `unit-tests` alone is only
670 of the 2,515 test files.

| Target | Scale | Result |
|---|---|---|
| `unit-tests` (win64) | 670 modules, 2,302 test modules | **1,154,412 assertions, 11 failed** |
| `unit-tests` (win32) | 2,311 test modules | **1,613,096 assertions, 11 failed** |
| `log-tests` | 1,687 tests across `fb`, `fblite`, `qb`, `deprecated` | **0 failed** |
| `warning-tests` | 68 files × 5 targets = 340 runs | **0 diagnostic changes** |

The 11 failures are all `fbc_tests.threads.threadcall_`, caused by `libffi` being
absent in this build environment (`-DDISABLE_FFI` compiles `fb_ThreadCall` to
`return NULL`). They are **present in the baseline before any USTRING work** and
are unrelated to it.

`warning-tests` compiles for **dos, linux-x86, linux-x86_64, win32 and win64**
and compares against committed reference output; every diagnostic on every
target is byte-identical to stock fbc.

> **One caveat, stated plainly.** The suite as shipped does not pass untouched.
> `tests/udt-wstring` and `tests/udt-zstring` each contain `#define ustring ...`
> in 18 files, which becomes `error 4: Duplicated definition` once `USTRING` is a
> keyword — fbc's own tests would not compile. They are renamed to `uwstr_t` /
> `uzstr_t`. Any upstream patch has to carry that 36-file rename.

### USTRING's own tests

| Suite | Checks | What it covers |
|---|---|---|
| `tests/ustring_lang_test.bas` | 140 | the language surface end to end |
| `tests/ustring_io_test.bas` | 36 | files, encodings, `PRINT USING`, round trips |
| `tests/ustring_gfx_test.bas` | 13 | `DRAW STRING`, compared **pixel by pixel** against the narrow path |
| `tests/ustr_codec_test.c` | 70 | UTF-8/16/32 codecs, including malformed input |
| `tests/ustr_core_test.c` | 38 | allocator, growth, temp-descriptor pool |
| `tests/ustr_wchar_test.c` | 25 | the conversion helpers at **all three wchar widths** |
| `tests/ustring_llvm_test.bas` | — | LLVM output byte-identical to `-gen gcc` |

`ustr_wchar_test.c` deserves a note: the wchar conversion branches fold away at
compile time, so on Windows the UTF-32 (Linux) and 8-bit (DOS) branches are dead
code that had never executed anywhere. The test includes the real source three
times, once per width, so all three run — and the harness was checked against a
deliberately injected bug to confirm it can actually fail.

### Platforms built and run

| Target | Built | Suites run |
|---|---|---|
| win64 | ✅ | lang 140/0, io 36/0, gfx 13/0 |
| win32 | ✅ | lang 140/0, io 36/0 |
| linux-x86_64 | ✅ | lang 140/0, io 36/0 |

Linux matters most, because `sizeof(wstring)` is 4 there — so the UTF-32 path is
exercised for real, not just by a unit test:

```
ustring units   = 4      "h" + é + 𝄞 (a surrogate pair)
sizeof(wstring) = 4
wstring chars   = 3      the pair collapses to one scalar
roundtrip units = 4
identical       = -1
```

Building for 32-bit is what uncovered the last real bug: literal emission in the
gas x86 backend, which is reachable *only* on 32-bit targets. Not tested yet:
ARM, JS and DOS.

```

`NOTES.md` is worth reading if you are reviewing this. It records the design
decisions *and* the mistakes — several bugs in this work compiled cleanly, ran,
and produced plausible output (an empty generated destructor, a silently
disabled copy-back, a no-op `LSET`, a `READ` that assigned nothing). They were
found by reading generated code and by stress testing, not by normal test
output, and the notes say so.

## Building

```
make rtlib gfxlib2 compiler
```

See `tests/BASELINE.md` for the exact invocations, the three test targets, and
the environment workarounds this particular machine needed (none of them related
to USTRING).

## Licence

This is a modified copy of the FreeBASIC compiler, so it carries FreeBASIC's
licensing **unchanged**. Nothing is relicensed and no licence was chosen — it is
inherited, and it is a split, because the USTRING work touches both halves:

| Part | Licence |
|---|---|
| The compiler — `src/compiler/`, and the `fbc32.exe` / `fbc64.exe` / `bin/fbc` binaries built from it | **GNU GPL v2 or later** ([COPYING.GPL-2.0](COPYING.GPL-2.0)) |
| The runtime and graphics libraries — `src/rtlib/`, `src/gfxlib2/`, i.e. libfb, libfbmt, libfbgfx, libfbgfxmt | **GNU LGPL v2.1 or later, with a static-linking exception** ([COPYING.LGPL-2.1](COPYING.LGPL-2.1)) |
| Documentation, including `doc/ustring.txt` | **GNU FDL** |

The linking exception is what lets a program link the runtime statically without
taking on the LGPL — it is quoted in full in [LICENSE](LICENSE).

So the USTRING work follows the file, exactly as the rest of fbc does: the
compiler-side changes are GPLv2+, and `ustr_*.c`, `fb_ustring.h` and the
`DRAW STRING` support are LGPLv2.1+ with the exception.

**The prebuilt trees carry third-party components.** `fbc-win/` and
`fbc-linux/` redistribute the toolchain fbc invokes — GNU binutils and gcc under
**GPLv3**, plus the MinGW-w64 runtime and import libraries under their own
terms. They are unmodified redistributions; see [LICENSE](LICENSE) for the
breakdown.

## Status

Implementation complete apart from `CONST`. Offered for upstream discussion.
